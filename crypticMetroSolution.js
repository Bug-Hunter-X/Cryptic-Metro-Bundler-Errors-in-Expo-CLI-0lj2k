Debugging these errors often requires a systematic approach:

1. **Check for conflicting dependencies:**  Run `npm ls` or `yarn why` to identify dependency conflicts or version mismatches.  Try updating or downgrading packages to compatible versions.
2. **Verify native modules:** If you're using native modules, ensure they are correctly linked and configured. Check for relevant build errors or installation problems.
3. **Clean the cache and reinstall dependencies:** Delete the `node_modules` folder, remove `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`), and reinstall all dependencies using `npm install` or `yarn install`.
4. **Inspect package.json:** Check for any incorrect or outdated dependencies that may cause conflicts.
5. **Examine Metro config (metro.config.js):** Ensure this file is correctly configured for your project's requirements.
6. **Check your Expo SDK version:** Ensure compatibility between your Expo SDK version and the other libraries used in your project. 
7. **Restart your machine/IDE:** Sometimes a simple restart resolves temporary glitches.
8. **Search for specific error messages:** Google the exact error message you're receiving; someone else may have encountered and solved the same problem.
