This error occurs when you try to run an Expo CLI command (like `expo start`) and get an unexpected error message related to the Metro bundler. The error messages are usually cryptic and don't directly point to the cause.  This often happens when there are issues with project dependencies, native modules, or the Expo CLI configuration itself. For example, you might see errors like `Invariant Violation: View config not found` or errors related to missing modules despite having them installed.
